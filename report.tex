Some introduction on the protocol

The focus of the security review was on the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Specific security concern 1.
\item
  Specific security concern 2.
\item
  Specific security concern 3.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Disclaimer:} This security review does not guarantee against a
hack. It is a snapshot in time of brink according to the specific commit
by a three person team. Any modifications to the code will require a new
security review.
